# Pi-sane
A Raspberry PI turning a USB scanner into a network scanner with:
- An old [Raspberry PI 3B v1.2](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) running [Raspberry PI OS Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/#raspberry-pi-os-32-bit)
- The [SANE](http://www.sane-project.org/) software in the [Debian libsane1](https://packages.debian.org/bookworm/libsane1) package
- A [Canon Canoscan LiDE 400](https://www.canon.co.uk/business/products/scanners/flatbed-scanners/canoscan-lide-400/) USB scanner

I'll be using the [Scanner page in the Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/Scanner) as my guide
and document my progress here ...
